Regularly we hear that economists talk about inverted yield curve and how they predict upcoming recessions. But what is the yield curve?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve), the yield curve is a curve showing several yields to maturity or interest rates across different contract lengths (2 month, 2 year, 20 year, etc. ...) for a similar debt contract. All the recessions in the US since 1970 have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs 3-month). Over the same time frame, every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession. The yield curve became inverted in the first half of 2019, for the first time since 2007. Even though future is not dependent on the past and potentially in the future the yield curve will not become inverted before the crisis but it is important to know the shape of the yield curve.

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. 


```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,
                     var = myvars, 
                     maturity = maturity)

# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()


df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)


yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 

```

## Plotting the yield curve

Now let us plot the yield curve.

```{r, yield_curve_1_plot_, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
# pd.long$Site <- factor(pd.long$Site,levels=unique(pd.long$Site))

yield_curve %>% 
mutate(var = factor(var, levels = unique(var))) %>% 
  #Plotting the graph with years on the x-axis and yields on the y-axis
ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price, color = as.factor(maturity))) +
#Facet_wrapping by maturity and var since the levels of maturity are ordered
    facet_wrap(var~ ., ncol = 2) + 
#Choosing the plot type to be a line graph
    geom_line() +
#Black and white theme
    theme_bw() +
#Setting the x-axis labels to be in date format in years
    scale_x_date(labels=date_format("%Y")) +
#Removing legend and bolding plot title
    theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
#Setting plot and axis titiles
    labs(y = '%', 
         title = 'Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960', 
         caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", x = "") 
    
```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r, yield_curve_2_plot2}

#Creating new data frame with years >= 1999 and new year and month variables
yield_curve_with_years <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01") %>% 
   mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date))
    
#Plotting the graph with the different maturities on x-axis, yields on y-axis and grouping the yields by month
ggplot(yield_curve_with_years, 
       aes(x = maturity, 
           y = price, 
           color = as.factor(year), 
           group = month)) +
#Facet wrap the plot by year
    facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4) +
#Choosing the plot to be a line graph 
    geom_line() +
#Choosing a black and white theme
    theme_bw() +
#Removing plot legend
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
#Setting plot labels
    labs(y = 'Yield (%)', title = 'US Yield Curve', caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", x = "Maturity") +
#Bolding plot title
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
    
```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#What third plot should look like
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r yield_curve_3_plot,out.width="100%",fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

#Creating new data frame with only 3m Treasury Bill and 10y Treasury Note, and years since 1999
yield_curve_3m_10m <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01", (maturity == "3m" | maturity == "10y"))

#Plotting graph with date on the x-axis and yields on the y-axis, colors grouped by var
ggplot(yield_curve_3m_10m, aes(x = date, y = price, color = var)) +
#Choosing plot to be a line graph   
    geom_line() +
#Choosing black and white theme   
    theme_bw() +
#Removing legend title and bolding plot title
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
#Setting plot and axis titles
    labs(y = '%', title = 'Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999', 
         caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", x = "") +
#Setting x-axis labels to be in 5 year increments
    scale_x_date(date_breaks="5 years",labels=date_format("%Y"), limits = c(as.Date("1999-01-01"),NA))
```



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`.

```{r, yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#The plot should look like this

yield_curve_final <- yield_curve %>%

  select(c("date","price","var")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "var", values_from = "price") %>% 
  mutate(difference=`10-Year Treasury Rate` - `3-Month Treasury Bill`)

#Plotting graph with date on the x-axis and the difference on the y-axis
ggplot(yield_curve_final, aes(x=date, y=difference)) +
#Choosing plot to be a line graph  
  geom_line() +

      subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages. \nShaded areas correspond to recessions", x="") +
#Selecting black and white theme
  theme_bw() +
#Fixing x-axis labels and limits
  scale_x_date(date_breaks="2 years",labels=date_format("%Y"), limits = c(as.Date("1959-01-01"),as.Date("2023-01-01"))) +
#Bolding plot title and removing legend
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "none") +
#Creating y-intercept line at 0
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="black") +
#Creating rugs at bottom of plot
  geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(difference >= 0,"steelblue2","red")), sides="b",alpha=0.5, position = "jitter") +
#Plotting the recession grey areas on plot
  geom_rect(data=filter(recessions), inherit.aes=F, aes(xmin=From, xmax=To, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='grey', alpha=0.7) +
#Plotting graph ribbons
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = difference, ymax = pmin(difference, 0)), fill= "steelblue2", alpha=0.5) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pmin(difference, 0)),fill = "red", alpha=0.5)

```
