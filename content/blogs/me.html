<p>Hi, my name is Muslim Dashaev!</p>
<p>Here you can find <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0b0i4rzju1hooui/Dashaev%20CV.pdf?dl=0">my CV</a>.</p>
<p>I finished the double degree programme at Higher School of Economics and University of London under the academic direction of London School Economics with distinction. Later, I have been also working there as a teacher’s assistant in Management Accounting and as a class teacher in Microeconomics-1. I am really passionate about teaching becase I like to explain and make complex things easier for understanding. Since my undergraduate degree, I have been enthusiastic about finance courses which involved studying the valuation of fixed income instruments, hedging, and models to value interest rate risk. Motivated by what I studied in terms of my degree, I decided that I want to pursue a career in Investment Management.</p>
<p>I have working experience in Quantitative Risk Management at VTB Bank and Project Valuation at Sberbank of Russia. At VTB Bank I understood the true meaning of collaboration as I worked as a part of a team that constructs various survival models using machine learning in R. I was responsible for researching the best model and implementing it into the bank’s systems.</p>
<p>As I wanted to get more experience of working with clients and providing them optimal solutions, I joined the Project Valuation team at Sberbank. There I provided a financial valuation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models that automated particular processes of the bank. It included a series of meetings with clients that I led, making assumptions, and then constructing financial models using the DCF approach. As a result, our team helped the bank to implement only the most efficient projects. It was a unique opportunity for me to create something significant within Sberbank.</p>
<p>However, I always wanted to gain international experience and study in a diversified environment. Currently, I am a full-time Masters in Financial Analysis student at London Business School. I appreciate how much teachers focus on applying theory to solve real life problems. For instance, I have recently developed a quantitative trading strategy that uses ARIMA and GARCH to outperform Buy &amp; Hold strategy. I am interested in Asset Management or Trading positions, and I believe that LBS will help me to expand my knowledge in financial markets.</p>
