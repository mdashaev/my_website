# GDP components over time and among countries

There are four main components of gross domestic product: personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). Here you can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

I will consider the GDP data from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.

I will consider how different components of GDP changed over time and compare different countries  by its GDP components estimates.


```{r read_GDP_data}
library(readxl)
UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#pivot_longer to transform data from wide format to long
tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>% pivot_longer(-c(CountryID, Country, IndicatorName), #which columns to preserve
                                               values_to = "Value", #the name of values column
                                               names_to = "year") %>%  #column with names of previous columns with years
                                 filter(!is.na(Value)) %>% #remain only finite values 
                                 mutate(bln_value = Value/10^9, #divide by 1 bln to get bln values
                                        year = as.numeric(year)) #transform year from chr to numeric
#see columns type of df
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

```

First, can you produce this plot?

of course!

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r perc_diff, out.width="100%", fig.width= 8, fig.height=6}

gdp_percentage_diff <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
                       pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, 
                                   values_from = bln_value,
                                   id_cols = c(Country, year)) %>% #transform groups from one column to multiple columns
                       mutate(GDP_calculated = `Gross capital formation` + 
                                               `Exports` + 
                                               `Government expenditure` +
                                               `Household expenditure` - 
                                               `Imports`,
                              GDP_percentage_difference = GDP_calculated / `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` - 1) %>% 
                      group_by(Country) %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(GDP_percentage_difference)) %>% 
                      summarise(mean_diff = abs(mean(GDP_percentage_difference, na.rm = T) * 100)) %>% 
                      arrange(desc(mean_diff)) #descending sort by mean difference %

gdp_percentage_diff %>% 
  head(n = 25) %>% #select top 25 countries (sorted previously by arrange)
ggplot(aes(y = reorder(Country, mean_diff), #sort countries by mean difference
           x = mean_diff)) +

theme_bw() +

     y = "Absolute mean difference",

     subtitle = "Top 25 countries that have the highest mean absolute difference \n between calculated GDP and GDP figure ")


#average mean by all countries
mean(abs(gdp_percentage_diff$mean_diff))

```

Yemen has the highest percentage difference between calculated GDP and provided GDP in the figure and deviates by 34% from the figure. Moreover, other countries in this list are  located either in the islands, in the Middle East or in Africa.

The average absolute mean difference percentage among all countries is 14.22% which is quite high. However, our top-25 contributes a lot to this  figure.

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

First of all, Germany and United States are developed countries which means that they should have similar patterns but some components of GDP demonstrate otherwise, while India is an emerging country. In our developed countries investment and government components of GDP intersected several times while in India there was a huge difference between them in 1970s and has increased during the 50-year period. The investment share in both developed countries is at the same level - 20% of total GDP - while in India it has almost doubled during the period.

Household expenditure in Germany and India has decreased during the discussed period but in America there was a reverse situation - consumer spending proportion has risen. Furthermore, household expenditure is still the largest part of GDP in all three countries.

Also, it is very interesting to consider Net exports proportion. India and USA has the similar movement pattern in this component: it moves in one direction in both countries and also is negative which means that imports outweigh exports. In Germany net exports proportion was around 0% but since 2000 it has increased almost to 10% of GDP.
