<h1>GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>There are four main components of gross domestic product: personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). Here you can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>I will consider the GDP data from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</p>
<p>I will consider how different components of GDP changed over time and compare different countries by its GDP components estimates.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by <code>1e9</code>, or <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span>), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

<p>What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Germany and United States are developed countries which means that they should have similar patterns but some components of GDP demonstrate otherwise, while India is an emerging country. In our developed countries investment and government components of GDP intersected several times while in India there was a huge difference between them in 1970s and has increased during the 50-year period. The investment share in both developed countries is at the same level - 20% of total GDP - while in India it has almost doubled during the period.</p>
<p>Household expenditure in Germany and India has decreased during the discussed period but in America there was a reverse situation - consumer spending proportion has risen. Furthermore, household expenditure is still the largest part of GDP in all three countries.</p>
<p>Also, it is very interesting to consider Net exports proportion. India and USA has the similar movement pattern in this component: it moves in one direction in both countries and also is negative which means that imports outweigh exports. In Germany net exports proportion was around 0% but since 2000 it has increased almost to 10% of GDP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to, please change <code>country_list &lt;- c(&quot;United States&quot;,&quot;India&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;)</code> to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like</p>
