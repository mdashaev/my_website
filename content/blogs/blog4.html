<p>There are four main components of gross domestic product: personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). Here you can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>I will consider the GDP data from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</p>
<p>We will see how different components of GDP changed over time and compare different countries by its GDP components estimates.</p>
<p>First, let us upload the data.</p>

                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to tidy the data and transform it into long format</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#pivot_longer to transform data from wide format to long

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>
<p>However, I have some doubts that GDP variable in the data is calculated correctly. Below in the code we calculate GDP as the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Let’s answer the question: What is the percentage difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>

<p>Yemen has the highest percentage difference between calculated GDP and provided GDP in the figure and deviates by 34% from the figure. Moreover, other countries in this list are located either in the islands, in the Middle East or in Africa.</p>
<p>The average absolute mean difference percentage among all countries is 14.22% which is quite high. However, our top-25 contributes a lot to this figure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I suggest to calculate GDP components as a percentage of total GDP and compare them by countries.</p>

<p>First of all, Germany and United States are developed countries which means that they should have similar patterns but some components of GDP demonstrate otherwise, while India is an emerging country. In our developed countries investment and government components of GDP intersected several times while in India there was a huge difference between them in 1970s and has increased during the 50-year period. The investment share in both developed countries is at the same level - 20% of total GDP - while in India it has almost doubled during the period.</p>
<p>Household expenditure in Germany and India has decreased during the discussed period but in America there was a reverse situation - consumer spending proportion has risen. Furthermore, household expenditure is still the largest part of GDP in all three countries.</p>
<p>Also, it is very interesting to consider Net exports proportion. India and USA has the similar movement pattern in this component: it moves in one direction in both countries and also is negative which means that imports outweigh exports. In Germany net exports proportion was around 0% but since 2000 it has increased almost to 10% of GDP.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s construct function that will help us to construct the graphs for any countries that we use as input.</p>
